=begin
 Exercise5. Let's say you want to run some Ruby code (such as a call to a shell
 command) repeatedly at a certain interval (for example, once every five seconds
 for one minute). Write a method for this. Do not use Thread class for now.
 Hint: yield and sleep methods may be required.

 def call_to_shell(&block)
  loop do
    yield block
    sleep 1
   end
 end

 a = ->(command) { puts rand(1..100000)}
 
 call_to_shell(&a)
